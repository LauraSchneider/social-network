## The Badass Adventure Seekers Social Network

**Tech Stack:** Javascript, React.js, Redux, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, AWS S3 bucket, Socket.io, HTML, CSS

I build a social network single page application in three weeks during the SPICED Academy full stack web dvelopment program. The social network, The Badass Adeventure Seekers, is for people who enjoy the outdoor activities where they can connect with individuals who share similar interests.

A user is able to register, login, upload a profile photo and share some information about themselves which pnoe can edit if needed. The user is able to see a list of his/her friends and pending friend requests, where s/he has the option to make, accept, cancel, and unfriend a friend. A chat group option is also available.
