## The Badass Adventure Seekers Social Network

**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, React.js, Redux, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, AWS S3 bucket, Socket.io, HTML, CSS



I built a social network single page application in three weeks during the SPICED Academy full stack web development program. The social network, The Badass Adventure Seekers, is for people who enjoy outdoor activities.

A user is able to register, login, upload a profile photo, and share some information about themselves which one can edit if needed. The user is able to see a list of his/her friends and pending friend requests, where s/he has the option to make, accept, cancel, and unfriend a friend. A chat group option is also available.
